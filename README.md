# Doctors-Office-Database
This project was created as part of the LIS2780 Database Concepts course. The goal was to design and implement a database system for a rural doctor’s office using Microsoft Access. This relational database was designed to be simple, practical, and capable of supporting day-to-day operations such as patient management, scheduling, and supply tracking. 

## In this project, I: 

- **Designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the doctor’s office operations.**
- **Converted the ERD into relational tables with appropriate fields, primary keys, and relationships.**
- **Populated the database with sample data and run example queries.**

## The Database Supports:

- Managing patients, doctors, and appointments
- Recording services (e.g., physical exams, minor surgeries)
- Tracking supplies and their suppliers
- Recording which supplies are used during appointments
- Generating useful reports and queries

## The example queries: 
- List of patients with appointments today
- Patients who most frequently visit the office
- Most commonly used services
- Suppliers providing the most frequently used supplies
- Weekly appointment schedules per doctor
